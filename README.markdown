# TTYtter

Unofficial maintenance and mirror of [Floodgap's TTYtter](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/).

The master branch will be pretty much what I'm running, but that doesn't mean I've not managed to break it in someway. The mirror branch will be updated if any official updates are made.

Putting this here since Floodgap don't provide a public version control system, just [directories](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/old/) of [previous](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/dist1/) [versions](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/dist2/).

Also, as an avid user I was/am concerned TTYtter may now become [abandonware](https://alpha.app.net/doctorlinguist/post/14713461#14708185) (see also [this post](http://morrick.me/archives/6292#ft1)) so I thought:

1. even if I don't have the Perl chops, someone else might have and might be more be encouraged to help if it is on here.
2. Having a full git history might help me one day understand the code
3. I could at least start by making small changes like making `ssl=1` the default...

...but in the process of compiling this repository I noticed that TTYtter had indeed been updated as recently as 14-Jan-2014 (making `ssl=1` the default; and a few [other small changes](https://gist.github.com/atomicules/8699347/revisions)) it's just that the version number was not changed from the 27-December-2012 2.1.0 release. However, since it took a bit of effort getting this into Git I'm still going ahead with the mirror. If development does pick up I can at least keep the mirror up to date easily and perhaps I can focus on point 2.

##Status 2015-09-09

Decided to pull my finger out and start maintaining. Taking baby steps though.
