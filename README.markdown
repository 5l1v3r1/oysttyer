The official fork and replacement for what was once [Floodgap's TTYtter](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/).

In order to get Cameron Kaiser's blessing, we've had to change the name, take out a new API key and keep the Floodgap Free Software License.

The master branch will be pretty much what I'm running, but that doesn't mean I've not managed to break it in someway. The mirror branch reflects all the historical official TTYtter updates.
