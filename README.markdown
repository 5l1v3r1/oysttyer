# TTYtter

Mirror of [Floodgap's TTYtter](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/).

Putting this here since Floodgap don't provide a public version control system, just [directories](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/old/) of [previous](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/dist1/) [versions](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/dist2/).

Also, as an avid user I was/am concerned TTYtter may now become [abandonware](https://alpha.app.net/doctorlinguist/post/14713461#14708185) (see also [this post](http://morrick.me/archives/6292#ft1)) so I thought:

1. even if I don't have the Perl chops, someone else might have and might be more be encouraged to help if it is on here.
2. Having a full git history might help me one day understand the code
3. I could at least start by making small changes like making `ssl=1` the default...

...but in the process of compiling this repository I noticed that TTYtter had indeed been updated as recently as 14-Jan-2014 (making `ssl=1` the default; and a few [other small changes](https://gist.github.com/atomicules/8699347/revisions)) it's just that the version number was not changed from the 27-December-2012 2.1.0 release. However, since it took a bit of effort getting this into Git I'm still going ahead with the mirror. If development does pick up I can at least keep the mirror up to date easily and perhaps I can focus on point 2.

##Status 2015-06-11

I still use TTYtter everyday, but I am a user not a developer. I am interested in maintaining, but I'm only going to really start trying to fix things when it breaks for me because I have about zero free time. I may occasionally add issues, but they are more like todos/reminders for me for sometime in the future.
