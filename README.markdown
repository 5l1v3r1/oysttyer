# TTYtter

Mirror of [Floodgap's TTYtter](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/). Version 2 changes only.

Putting this here since Floodgap don't provide a public version control system, just a [directory of previous versions](http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/dist2/).

Also, TTYtter may now become [abandonware](https://alpha.app.net/doctorlinguist/post/14713461#14708185) so even if I don't have the Perl chops, someone might be encouraged to help if it is on here.
